# Crow-Football-Pool-Leaderboard

[Visit Page](https://marxspawn.github.io/Crow-Football-Pool-Leaderboard/)

HTML page to display football pool leaderboard and weekly winner from our family football pool being played at RunYourPool.com

We do not play for money, we play for points to win bragging rights. Since the website does not allow for me to add bonus points to members that win the pool each week, I have created this simple HTML table to be viewed from phones so members can easily keep up with who is winning the pool as well as who won the bonus points, their record, and total points for that week including the bonus points.
