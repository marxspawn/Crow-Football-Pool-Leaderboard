# Crow-Football-Pool-Leaderboard

https://marxspawn.github.io/Crow-Football-Pool-Leaderboard/

HTML page to display football pool leader board and weekly winner from our family football pool being played at RunYourPool.com

Since the website does not allow for me to add bonus points to members that win the pool each week, I have created this simple HTML table to be viewed from phones so members can easily keep up with who is winning the pool as well as who won the bonus points for that week
